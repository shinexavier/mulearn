# Discord Bot

This directory will house the source code for the μLearn Discord bot.

The bot will be responsible for:
* Relaying on-chain events to the Discord server
* Capturing user interactions and sending them to the μLearn middleware
* Providing a familiar user interface for the community

The bot will integrate with the `protocol` service to ensure seamless communication with the rest of the μLearn ecosystem.
