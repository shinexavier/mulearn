# μLearn Framework

This directory contains the base framework and starter kits for implementing the μLearn decentralized ecosystem.

## Overview

The μLearn framework is designed to be a decentralized, trust-minimized ecosystem for a peer-learning community. It leverages technologies such as W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Hyperledger Fabric to create a secure and portable reputation system for learners.

## Reference Specification

A detailed technical specification and architectural blueprint for the μLearn platform can be found in the [ReferenceSpec.md](docs/ReferenceSpec.md) file. This document outlines the core components, protocols, actors, and data models that form the foundation of the framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with the framework, please review the [ReferenceSpec.md](docs/ReferenceSpec.md) to understand the overall architecture and design principles. Subsequent starter kits and code samples will be added to this directory to facilitate development.
