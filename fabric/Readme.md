# Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode

This directory is intended to hold the Hyperledger Fabric chaincode for the Î¼Learn project.

The chaincode will be responsible for:
* Managing tasks
* Minting and burning KarmaTokens
* Handling governance-related transactions

The specification mentions three chaincode modules: `TaskChaincode`, `KarmaToken`, and `Governance`. These will be developed here.
